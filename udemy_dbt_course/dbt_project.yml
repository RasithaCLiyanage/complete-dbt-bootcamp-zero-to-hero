# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

    # This is a good place to set default values for your models. You can override
    # these values in the individual model files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

    # For example, you could set the default materialization to "table" for all
    # models in this project by setting `+materialized: view` or `+materialized: table` here.
    +materialized: view
    +enabled: true
